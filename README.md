# Gassy Donkey
[](docs/logo.png)
Welcome to my Unity 5.3.5 2D Gassy Donkey project!

This project will not be finished as I was just curios about how Unity worked while I was also polishing up my C# skills after spending two years dealing with Ember.js and Rails working on Fakktion (which is also open source.)

All detailed information about what I was planning for this game can be found in the [Game Idea Overview](docs/Gassy Donkey Game Idea.pdf).
