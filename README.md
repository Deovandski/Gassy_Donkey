# Gassy Donkey
![](/docs/logo.png)

**Welcome to my Unity 5.3.5 2D Gassy Donkey project!**

This project will not be finished as I was just curios about how Unity worked while I was also polishing up my C# skills after spending two years dealing with Ember.js and Rails working on Fakktion (which is also open source.)

All detailed information about what I was planning for this game can be found in the [Game Idea Overview](docs/GassyDonkeyGameIdea.pdf).

## Current Project State
